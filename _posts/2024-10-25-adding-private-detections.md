We’re always keeping an eye on new phishing tricks and tools that cybercriminals use, trying to stay a step ahead. Recently, we noticed that some phishing platforms targeting Microsoft services are finding ways around the popular <i>didsomeoneclone.me</i> detections.

To tackle this, we’re rolling out something new for our Enterprise users: <b>private detections</b>. These are custom <i>didsomeoneclone.me</i> implementations available only to a select group of users. Because they’re private, it’s much harder for attackers to figure them out and bypass them.

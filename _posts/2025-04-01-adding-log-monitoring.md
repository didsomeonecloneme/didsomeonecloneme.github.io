We're adding a new Microsoft feature to our Enterprise plan: **Log Monitoring**. This feature monitors your Microsoft 365 environment for malicious Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) activity. Our system leverages unique intelligence gathered through security research on the latest AiTM frameworks. When malicious activity is detected in your Microsoft tenant(s), you'll receive an immediate email notification.

## Easy to Use
We've designed Log Monitoring to be accessible to everyone. Our team provides assistance with the technical setup and ensures a streamlined onboarding process. No complex SIEM or setup is required.

## Driven by Security Research
We continuously enhance our Log Monitoring system by conducting security research on emerging AiTM SaaS platforms.

## All Data in Your Microsoft Environment
With our Enterprise Plan, all data remains within your Microsoft environment. The Monitoring service operates entirely within your Azure infrastructure.

## Get notified
If malicious activity is identified, you will get notified through an email:

## How to deploy
The Log Monitoring feature is part of our Enterprise plan, which allows you to host your own private **didsomeoneclone.me** instance in your Azure subscription and keep all data in-house. 

Our Enterprise plan is [available on the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/zolderbv1714139676050.didsomeonecloneme?tab=Overview) and starts at a price of â‚¬500 per month.

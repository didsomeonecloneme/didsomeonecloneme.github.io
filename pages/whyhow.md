## Why DSCM?

DSCM is a tool that helps you to detect malicious <a href="/what-is-website-cloning/">clones</a> of your website. Malicious clones are often used in phishing attacks to mislead victims. DSCM also detects more advanced phishing techniques, such as <a href="/microsoft-tenant-installation">Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)</a> phishing attacks. 

When it detects your website being abused in a phishing attack, it alerts you by email, so you can take action. For example, <a href="/report-a-website-clone/">reporting the phishing website</a>, inform your users, and investigate the incident to protect your website, reputation and visitors.

## How to use DSCM?

Activate the service using the following steps:
- Sign up by using the form on the <a href="/">homepage</a>, fill in your website domain name and email address
- Embed the generated link into your websites HTML source code (<a href="/installation">installation</a>)
- Profit! Get notified once your website is victim of a phishing attack

### What is the Authenticity Seal?
The Authenticity Seal is a security feature that helps you verify you're on the genuine Microsoft login page. Think of it as a unique "watermark" that appears on official Microsoft login pages. Each organization has its own unique seal. The symbol changes every month.

### How to Use the Authenticity Seal
1. Before entering your login credentials, always check for the Authenticity Seal in the top right corner
2. When in doubt, compare it with the current seal shown in your Teams or Outlook app
3. Only proceed with login if the seals match exactly

### Important Security Rules
1. **No Seal = No Login**: If you don't see the correct Authenticity Seal, do not enter your credentials
2. **Red Warning = Stop**: If you see any red warning messages, stop immediately and do not proceed
3. **When in Doubt**: Contact your IT support team if you're unsure about a login page

In our Premium plan, we automatically conduct technical analysis after detecting a clone. This analysis includes the following information:
* whois details
* requests performed when visiting the clone
* hashes of the cloned pages

Automatically collecting this information offers several advantages:
* Eliminates the need for expertise in website analysis
* Ensures that even if the clone is inaccessible (e.g., down), all technical details remain available for further investigation.

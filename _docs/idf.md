In order to prevent alert fatigue we are filtering out false positive detections. We only want to notify you when it matters. If you want to retrieve ALL notifications without us filtering the detections, you can opt-out from our Intelligent detection filtering functionality. This will forward all detections, but may contain more false positives. You can opt-in/opt-out at any time.

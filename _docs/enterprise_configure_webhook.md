During the deployment of our Enterprise Plan, we will ask you to define a Microsoft Teams Webhook. Instructions on how to create a Teams Webhook can be found at the following [Microsoft page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/post-a-workflow-when-a-webhook-request-is-received-in-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498). Define the URL returned by these steps into our deployment wizard. Administrator notifications are send to this Teams channel. This allows you to monitor activity of your system, but also review your detections.

Follow these steps to set up and start using **didsomeoneclone.me Enterprise** in your Azure environment.

## 1. Deploy the Service
Click <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/zolderbv1714139676050.didsomeoneclonemedscmenterprise" target="_blank">here</a> to go to the Azure Portal deployment page. Login with the account that has access to the subscription that you would like to use for deployment.
Click create and use the deployment wizard to set up the service in your Azure Subscription.
During the deployment specify an admin emailaddress and the other settings.

## 2. Access the Management Resource
Once the deployment is finished, open your web browser and go to the management resource. The URL will look something like this: `https://dscm-management-xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net/`

Replace `xxxxxx` with the specific name assigned during deployment.

## 3. Log In
Log in to the management portal using your admin email address defined in the first step. If the login doesn’t work right away, don’t worry—it might take a few minutes for everything to be ready. Try again later a few minutes later.

## 4. Start Using the Platform
Once logged in, you’re ready to start using your Enterprise environment.

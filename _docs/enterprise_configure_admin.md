During the Azure deployment of the Enterprise Plan, we will ask your for an administrator email address. This email is used as the administrator username. After the deployment, you can use this emailaddress to login to your Enterprise instance. The webinterface of the instance is located on the dscm-management-xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net resource. You can access it by browsing to https://dscm-management-xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net.

We offer manual reviews of your detections in our Enterprise Plan. We will review your detections before notifications are being send to your users. In order to use this feature, we ask your permission to share the detections with us. If you allow the detection sharing, we will also receive a notification when a detection occurs. Otherwise, we are unable to perform the manual reviews.

Within our Premium plan, we provide a clone mitigation feature that empowers our end users to activate it. Once activated, this feature effectively blocks victims from submitting any information to the phishing site. This proactive measure prevents victims from disclosing sensitive information, including usernames, passwords, and financial details.

Please note that our mitigation feature is only compatible with installations that load DSCM through a script. For example: this is currently not supported in our Microsoft 365 implementation.

## Step 1: Install DSCM Plugin
Begin by downloading the DSCM plugin from the official Joomla Extensions Directory (JED) at <a href="https://extensions.joomla.org/instant-search/" target="_blank">extensions.joomla.org</a>. Search for "**Did someone clone me**" in the JED search bar.

## Step 3: Configure DSCM Settings
After successfully installing the DSCM plugin on your website, let's set it up to receive notifications when someone clones your site. Go to the official DSCM website at [https://didsomeoneclone.me](https://didsomeoneclone.me), input your Joomla website's domain and your email address, and then patiently wait for a few seconds.

You will receive an email containing your personal link. Click the “Confirm email address” button in the email. On the destination page, your personal link is displayed:

Click on the plugin, and you'll be redirected to a dedicated page for it. Within the plugin settings, look for a specific section where you can add and configure links. Once you've configured the link, simply click the '**Save**' button. This action will embed the link into your website.
